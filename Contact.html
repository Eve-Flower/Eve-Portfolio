        Contact Page layout:
        navbar
        left side of page will say: Want to contact me? and then go into how contacting me can help and how to contact (simpyl fill in the form on the right and I'll get an email)
        right side of page is a form (in its infancy), with a first name, email, and what they want to say. This will be sent to my email
        there will be a thank you for sending popup or page shift after the user sends the message so they know it went through.
