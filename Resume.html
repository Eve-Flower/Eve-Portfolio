<!-- Resume layout:
First, the nav
Next, we want to have sections containing lists for contact information, summary (maybe), education, projects, and experience.  

Contact info has name, phone number (maybe, because I want to prevent spam), and Email
Education will have a dropdown menu for recent courses (in the past year) and my Major/minor, and expected dates
Projects will contain a list of projects, will just put my basic github projects in for now, and plug in this one too, with a placeholder image that I will turn into a hover gif of the project
Experience can have my work experience as a mechanic and other things (might scrap this section in favor of narrowness)

The end will have a contact me call to action (something like: "link(contact me) to let me know how I can help you")
