    <!--
        Body layout for this landing page in relation to objectives:
        Hyperlinks between all pages on the site with relative urls -> Navbar on the top right (alignment in the future) 
        at least one hyperlink to external sites -> socials in the center of the page ( centering in the future), this is also a unordered list
        sufficient text to require two heading styles -> landing heading and the beginnings of the "Projects" scroll down functionality to extend the webpage
        at least one list, ordered or unordered -> two unordered lists. One for the nav and one to display social links
        at least one div tag -> three divs to seperate the navbar from my name in the center with the socials, and the third div for the projects section
        span in the first h1 to color my name
        notes:
        - remember to change relative links when pushing into github, this is not done now since I have two folders for the assignment

    <h1>This page is poorly written</h1>
    <p>
      There are many things wrong with this page. It's not so bad that it won't
      work on most browsers, but it has many things that could be written much
      better. Your job is to use this code as a starting point and improve it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      You could, of course, cheat!
      <p>
        There is nothing wrong with using an HTML cleaner such as HTMLTidy, nor
        in using an accessibility checker like the W3 site to ensure your code
        works well. In fact, we would highly recommend that you do this whenever
        you create web pages because they help to ensure your code is compatible
        with standards and accessible to as many people as possible. Similarly,
        it makes perfect sense to use a WYSIWYG HTML editor such as Dremweaver
        orthe open source KompoZer when actually writing web pages. For the
        purposes of this exercise, however, you may learn more effectively if
        you avoid doing that until you are fairly comfortable that you have made
        as many changes as you can with just the aid of references. The main
        reason we are learning HTML is so that we can write dynamic JavaScript
        programs that are embedded within and which use and manipulate HTML, CSS
        and other browser technologies. If you take short cuts at this point,
        you will find it <i>much</i> harder later on. Remember, while marks will
        be lost if you don't take care to deal with the problems on these pages,
        the main things we are looking for relate to your ability to use the
        technology well and effectively, paying close attention to the design
        needs you have already identified

    <h3>
      Adding links
      <p>
        <a href="https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/file.php/310/html/sample2.html"
        >This is a link to the other page in this badly written pair of
          pages</a
        >. It uses a relative URL to point to a file in the same file system.
        This is necessary if you are building a site for portability, so that
        you can move it from one place (say your local computer) to another
        (say, your website).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.athabascau.ca/">
          And this is a link to Athabasca's main site</a
        >
        It uses an absolute URL that points to a unique web address. When the
        site moves, it will still point to that same address.
      </p>
    </h3>
    <h3>Using pictures</h3>
    <p>
      Pictures are not a part of a web page - the HTML page includes a link that
      tells the browser to embed the image (if it can) and some extra optional
      attributes such as its position relative to the text. It is far preferable
      to use stylesheets for this kind of formatting, but that's a subject for
      the next unit.
